      "text": "Season pork generously with salt, then rub with 1 Tbsp. oil total. Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Cook pork chops, moving once or twice to hotter areas of skillet, until first side is deeply browned, 6–9 minutes. Turn pork chops and cook until second sides are browned, about 5 minutes. Working one at a time, set chops on fatty side with tongs to melt and brown fat cap, about 1 minute each. At this point an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each chop should register 135°."

    {
      "text": "Add thyme, garlic, and butter to skillet and swirl to melt butter. Tilt skillet toward you so butter pools in the pan and spoon foaming butter over chops continuously until butter is browned, about 1 minute. Transfer pork chops, thyme, and garlic to a cutting board and let meat rest while you assemble the salad."

      "text": "Combine shallot and a couple of pinches of salt in a large bowl. Pour vinegar from reserved cranberries into bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add remaining 3 Tbsp. oil. Add cranberries, celery, parsley, almonds, Parmesan, and several pinches of salt; toss to combine."
