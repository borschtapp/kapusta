  "description": "Whether this Thanksgiving\ncenterpiece incites horror, amazement, or confusion when it’s served,\nit’s certain to evoke some kind of outburst. Warning: This dish is not\nrecommended for people who require an inch of space between food groups.\nGame plan: You’ll need to make the mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, sausage stuffing, and gravy\n before you begin; the sweet potatoes can be made ahead as well. Rewarm\neverything except the cranberry sauce just prior to assembling the cake,\n so it’s all easy to spread.\nIf your attention lapses and the marshmallows happen to burn or catch\n fire while broiling (this actually happened to us), relax and just blow\n out the flames. Peel away the burnt marshmallows, leaving the sweet\npotato layer intact, and start over with a fresh topping of\nmarshmallows.\nThis recipe was featured as part of our 6 Thanksgiving Turkey Recipes, Traditional to Trippy.\n                |\n        by \n        Amy Wisniewski\n        \n\n\n            ",

      "text": "\n    For the turkey layers:\t1Heat the oven to 350°F and arrange a rack in the middle. Coat 2 (8-inch) cake pans with butter; set aside.\t2Place\n all of the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix, using clean\nhands, until combined (don’t squeeze or overwork). Divide the mixture\nevenly between the pans, spreading it to the edges and smoothing out the\n top. Bake until cooked through and the cakes begin to pull away from\nthe edges of the pans, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven (but leave\n the oven on) and let cool for about 10 minutes. Using a paper towel,\nblot away any excess fat from the cake layers’ surface; set aside.\n(While the turkey cakes are cooking, make the sweet potatoes.)\nFor the sweet potato layer:\t1Place\n a steamer basket in a large saucepan with a tightfitting lid. Add\nenough water to reach just below the basket; bring to a boil over high\nheat, then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer.\t2Meanwhile,\n peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Once the water\nis simmering, place the cubes in the steamer basket, cover, and steam\nuntil the potatoes just give when pierced with a fork, about 20 to 25\nminutes. Transfer the steamer basket with the potatoes to a plate; set\naside.\t3Discard the water\nin the saucepan. Place the milk and butter in the saucepan and heat over\n low heat until the butter has melted. Turn off the heat, add the\nreserved sweet potatoes and the brown sugar, measured salt, and mace or\nnutmeg, and mash with a potato masher until smooth. Taste and season\nwith salt and pepper as desired; keep warm.\nTo assemble:\t1Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven.\t2Run\n a knife around the edge of the turkey cakes. Unmold one of the turkey\nlayers and place it bottom-side up on an overturned 8-inch cake pan or\nin an ovenproof serving dish. \n With a long knife or offset spatula, evenly spread 1 1/4 cups of the\nmashed potatoes over the top of the cake, leaving a 1/2 -inch border\n(keep the remaining potatoes warm). \t3Using the back of a clean spoon, spread the cranberry sauce evenly over the mashed potatoes. \t4Using\n your hands, gently pack the stuffing in an even layer over the\ncranberry sauce, using one hand to keep any stuffing from falling off\nthe side.  Press gently on the stuffing to make sure it adheres to the mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.\t5Evenly spread another 1 1/4 cups of the mashed potatoes over the stuffing (keep the remaining potatoes warm). \t6Unmold the second turkey layer and place it bottom-side up on top of the mashed potatoes. \t7Transfer\n the cake pan or serving dish with the partially assembled cake to a\nbaking sheet and bake until heated through, about 30 to 40 minutes (an\ninstant-read thermometer should register 165°F).\t8Remove from the oven and set aside. Heat the oven to broil.\t9With\n a long knife or offset spatula, evenly coat the outside (but not top)\nof the entire cake with the remaining mashed potatoes (you may have a\nlittle left over). \t10With a clean long knife or offset spatula, evenly spread all of the sweet potatoes on top of the cake.  Arrange the marshmallows across the top and gently press them into the sweet potatoes. \t11Return\n the baking sheet with the assembled cake to the oven and broil until\nthe marshmallows are golden, about 1 to 2 minutes (watch closely so the\nmarshmallows don’t burn).  Using two flat spatulas, carefully transfer the cake to a serving dish. Serve immediately with gravy, if desired.\n\n      \n        \n            \n        \n      \n  "
