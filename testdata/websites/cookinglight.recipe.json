  "description": "This meatless bowl offers a range of textures and flavors, including cumin-scented black beans, blistered tomatoes, corn, and fresh avocado that are equally good at room temperature. If you donâ€™t have time to stew your own beans, canned unsalted beans work just as well here. Feel free to mix it all together instead of portioning into quadrants. Finish it with a squeeze of lime, if you like.",

Add the corn to the pan; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the corn next to the tomatoes. Add the avocado slices, radish slices, and cilantro to the bowl.
