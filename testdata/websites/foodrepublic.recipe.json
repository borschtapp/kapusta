Longstanding Midtown dining spot \u003ca href=\"http://www.michaelsnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMichael's New York\u003c/a\u003e, owned by restaurateur Michael McCarty, boasts a Dutch recipe we had to try: citrus-steamed Dutch white asparagus (they actually do a mix of white and green) with a wine-spiked butter sauce, a runny poached egg and a little Parmesan cheese. A little prosciutto never hurt anyone, either. \u003c/p\u003e",
