  "description": "Spiced butternut squash blended with nutritional yeast and a little plant milk makes a delightfully rich and “cheesy” sauce for pasta and broccoli. Pumpkin, acorn squash, or delicata squash will also work in this recipe. To make this recipe gluten-free, chose a whole grain pasta made with rice, corn, and/or quinoa. \u003cimg alt=\"butternut broccoli vegan mac and cheese\" data-pin-url=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes/vegan-pasta-noodles/butternut-mac-and-cheese-broccoli/\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/wp-content/uploads/butternut-broccoli-mac-and-cheese-wordpress.jpg\" data-pin-description=\"Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese with Broccoli\" data-src=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/wp-content/uploads/butternut-broccoli-mac-and-cheese-wordpress.jpg\" class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image lazyload\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /\u003e\u003cnoscript\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/wp-content/uploads/butternut-broccoli-mac-and-cheese-wordpress.jpg\" class=\"ss-hidden-pin-image\" alt=\"butternut broccoli vegan mac and cheese\" data-pin-url=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes/vegan-pasta-noodles/butternut-mac-and-cheese-broccoli/\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.forksoverknives.com/wp-content/uploads/butternut-broccoli-mac-and-cheese-wordpress.jpg\" data-pin-description=\"Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese with Broccoli\"/\u003e",
