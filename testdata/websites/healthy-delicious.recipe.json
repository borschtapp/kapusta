  "description": "Baked flautas stuffed with seasoned, shredded chicken, spinach, and cheese are crispy, but donâ€™t have the greasiness of fried versions. To shred poached chicken easily, put it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium for 45 seconds. Store-bought rotisserie chicken can be substituted for the poached chicken to save time. You might also like Baked Buffalo Chicken Taquitos",
