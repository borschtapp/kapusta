Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSnap the chocolate into a large bowl, add the butter and place over a pan of simmering water, until melted, stirring regularly. Stir through the cherries and nuts (if using). \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSift the cocoa powder and flour into a separate bowl, add the baking powder and sugar, then mix together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd the dry ingredients to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture and stir together well. Beat the eggs, then mix in until you have a silky consistency.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePour the brownie mix into the baking tin, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don’t want a skewer to come out clean – the brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but still gooey in the middle. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares. Delicious served with a dollop of crème fraîche or yoghurt mixed with some orange zest.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"
