    {
      "text": "Place a small plate in the freezer. Wash the strawberries and cut them into quarters. In a large pot, combine the jam sugar and strawberries, stirring until well combined. Let that sit for approx. 1 hr."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the meantime, mix the matcha powder with half of the water in a small bowl to make a paste. Gradually stir in the remaining water until everything is well mixed and dissolved. Set aside."
    },
    {
      "text": "After the strawberries have rested and there's some juice in the pot, set the pot over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for approx. 5 min., then add the matcha to the pot and continue cooking for approx. 1 min."
    },
    {
      "text": "To test whether the jam will set up once it's cooled, place a small spoonful of the hot jam on the \r\n plate from the freezer and hold the plate at an angle. If the mass becomes solid after a short time and you can swipe your finger through the jam leaving an unconnected gap, the test is passed and the jam is ready; if not, continue cooking and repeating the test. Pour the still hot jam into sterilized preserving jars, seal, and let cool. Enjoy!"
