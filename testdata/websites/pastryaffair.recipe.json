  "description": "This is part IV in a mini-series of Harry Potter snacks from the books\nbrought to life (part I is on Honeydukes treats, part II is all about the\ncauldron cakes, and part III features every wizard's favorite\ndrink—butterbeer!).\n\nI confess that Butterbeer Cupcakes aren't actually mentioned in the Harry\nPotter series. In my defense, if JK Rowling had been given one of these\nwhile writing the books, she would have found a way to fit them in. They\nare so exceptional, I wouldn't be surprised if she featured them as a major\nplot point.\n\nI'm only half joking.\n\nHumor aside, the release of the final movie is upon us. I'm a mixed bag of\nemotions right now—thrilled to see the last movie and devastated to see the\nseries finally come to a close. It's not only the end of the series but the\nend of an era—an era that defined my generation in a small, significant\nway. Though I knew this day would come, I find I'm not ready to say\nfarewell. I want to hold onto the magic just a little bit longer.\n\nYet, as I keep reminding myself, this isn't really goodbye.\n\nMy collection of Harry Potter books isn't going anywhere. The movies are\nnot suddenly going to vanish from the shelves. I can revisit the\ncharacters, these friends I have gotten to know over the last decade,\nwhenever I choose. We can still get together for long weekends and lazy\nSunday afternoons. Though the characters will no longer evolve or set out\non new adventures, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like the familiar\ncomfort of an old friend, you know they'll always be around, waiting\npatiently on your bookshelf.\n\nI don't know about you, but I can always use the comfort of an old friend.\n\nThese Butterbeer Cupcakes are easily on my list of the top three cupcakes\nof all time (if you put another one in front of me, I just may declare\nthese the winner). These are unbelievably delicious—in fact, they didn't\neven last a full 24 hours in my house.\n\nThe butterbeer cupcake is essentially a brown sugar cupcake infused with\ncream soda and butter flavors. If that isn't good enough, the cupcakes are\nthen filled with a butterscotch ganache, topped with a rich butterscotch\nbuttercream, and drizzled with more butterscotch ganache. I'm not typically\na fan of butterscotch, but these cupcakes absolutely changed my mind. The\ncupcake itself leans more on the denser side, but it still manages to feel\nlight. The butterscotch buttercream is sweet, but not teeth-fall-out sweet\n(I don't typically like sweet frostings, but I ate this one by the\nspoonful. So good). Don't even get me started on the butterscotch\nganache...\n\nYou need to make these. I don't want to hear any excuses—no ifs, ands, or\nbuts about it. You can thank me later.",
